## <sub> Getting Started </sub>

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

```shell
commands here
```

> You should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### <sup> Installation </sup>

Include steps to install any prerequisits

<table align="right"><tr><td>

<a href="#top" title="Return to top">:top:</a></td></tr></table>

## <sub> Configuration </sub>

Below is a configuration check to ensure each expected variable is defined and passed as a configuration export.

### <sup> Artifactory </sup>

Include configurations to pull packages from a private *Artifactory* if avaliable

### <sup> Environment variables</sup>

Include environment variables that aren't included in project (or where to find them)

<table align="right"><tr><td>

<a href="#top" title="Return to top">:top:</a></td></tr></table>

## <sub> Developing </sup>

### <sup> Built With </sup>
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### <sup> Prerequisites </sup>
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### <sup> Setting up Dev </sup>

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

> State what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

<table align="right"><tr><td>

<a href="#top" title="Return to top">:top:</a></td></tr></table>

## <sub> Maintinence </sub>

Provide details on avaliable tools for maintaining project

## <sub> Testing </sub>

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

### <sub> Building </sub>

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

> State what actually happens when the code above gets executed.

<table align="right"><tr><td>

<a href="#top" title="Return to top">:top:</a></td></tr></table>

## <sub> Versioning </sub>

> :soon: Implement [SemVer][sem-ver-url] for version automation.


### <sup> Deploying / Publishing </sup>
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

> Tell what the previous code actually does.
